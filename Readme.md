# Coding Challenge Solution
# Requirements
- Ruby = 2.3

# Setup
- Goto project's folder in your terminal
- run `bundle install`
- now run `ruby bin/bakery_runner.rb` to manually
- enter reservation requests on stdin or pass a filename

# Testing
if you want to run the specs please run `rspec .` in project's home directory.

if you want to run fully end-to-end integration tests please run `ruby test/integration.rb` in project's home directory.

you can also run both the specs & intregration tests with `test/all` in project's home directory, after setting execution flag for that file (`chmod u+x test/all` for Unix/OS X)
